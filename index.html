<h1>Think about a misunderstanding people have about your cause. Provide a written argument that will help resolve this misunderstanding without triggering the backfire effect. </h1>
  </div><p>
One misunderstanding people have about happiness, is that it can be gained through changes in financial standing. While not everyone may see money as the root of happiness, most people see themselves as being happier if they suddenly acquired large sums of money, like winning the lottery. However, asking actual lottery winners, many say that they wish they never had won. Winning meant people around them coming back into their lives asking for money, overwhelming responsibilities, and large life changes. These changes often led to living in a new place, broking off old relationships, and creating new relationships with different classes of people than before. In doing this, many people ended up unhappy, as they felt their only worth was now their money and not who they were. Even worse, a statistic I found has a whopping 70% of lottery winners going broke within a few years. So, it is obvious, a sudden large change in financial status does not make people happier. <p>
<div style="background-color:#500E4C; color:white;"><h1>So how can we resolve this misunderstanding without triggering the backfire effect?</h1>
<h1>Types of Backfire Effect </h1></div>
<p>1. Familiarity Effect </br>
2. Overkill Effect </br>
3. Worldview Effect</p>
<div style="background-color:#500E4C; color:white;"><h1>What they mean:<h1></div>
<h2>Familiarity Effect </h2>
<p>A myth which someone believes before they are corrected may be more familiar to that person, and if they are told it is wrong they may keep believing that myth because they are more familiar with it. </p>
<h2>Overkill Effect</h2>
<p>When too many arguments are provided against a myth someone believes, they are more inclined to feel attacked and stand behind the myth even when the arguments being told are true.</p>
<h2>Worldview Effect</h2>
<p>Providing evidence towards a myth which is part of someone’s world view makes it very likely that person will feel attacked. They feel as though by changing their opinion on this myth, they are losing value and therefore are more willing to resist listening.</p>

<div style="background-color:#500E4C; color:white;"><h1>How to Help Resolve Misunderstandings</h1></div>
<h2>Fighting Familiarity Effect</h2>
<p> To increase people’s familiarities with a new idea backed by evidence, the emphasis should be on the facts, not on the myth which the person comes in believing. This is to increase their familiarity with the facts in order to get over this challenge. In the case of happiness, facts such as the percentage of lottery winners who feel unhappy after the change could be used.
</p>
<h2>Fighting Overkill Effect</h2>
<p> The solution is to keep your content lean, mean, and easy to read. This means simple language, short sentences, subheadings and paragraphs. Avoif dramatic language and derogatory comments that alienate people. Stick to facts. Therefore, when explaining about how financial success does not effect happiness, just keep it simple and stick to the easy facts. 
</p>
<h2>Fighting Worldview Effect</h2>
<p> First, you are more likely to correct misinformation among those not as firmly decided about hot button issues. Secondly, messages can be presented alongside self-affirmation, were one is allowed to remind themselves of how their own values are correct. Finally, arguments may be framed in different ways which are less threatening to one’s world view. When trying to explain that financial change does not effect happiness, you could ask people what makes them happy to help them see your point. </p>
